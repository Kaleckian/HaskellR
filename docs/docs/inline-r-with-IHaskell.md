title: Using inline-r with IHaskell
---

HaskellR features integration with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and
the [IHaskell][ihaskell] kernel for interactively authoring notebooks
replete with plots, formulas, R code and Haskell code.

See "Building and installing" to get started and the
[tutorial notebook](https://github.com/tweag/HaskellR/blob/master/IHaskell/examples/tutorial-ihaskell-inline-r.ipynb)
in the repository for a walkthrough.
