## Need help?

There are multiple support channels available in case you need help.

* Common issues are covered by the [FAQ](docs/faq.html).
* For general questions, comments, feedback and community support
  please write a message to the
  [HaskellR mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/haskellr).
* If you spot a bug, typo or have feature requests please
  [open an issue](https://github.com/tweag/HaskellR/issues/new).
* [Tweag I/O](http://tweag.io) provides professional support, see
  [below](#professional-support).

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell)
and the `#haskell` IRC channel on Freenode are good resources for
asking questions and finding answers regarding Haskell.

R, like Haskell, is an open source project with a vibrant user
community. The best resources to get started are the
[official R manuals](http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html). If
you're stuck, the community also has
[several mailing lists](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html) and
[extensive user contributed documentation](http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html).

## Professional support

[Tweag I/O](http://tweag.io) provides professional support for H,
inline-r and related packages of the HaskellR project. This provides
you with direct access to the people who created it. Say
[hello@tweag.io](mailto:hello@tweag.io) for enquiries about how we can
assist you or for customized features.
